      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

                        Your first step in geting down in an adventurer such as this Dungeons & Dragons Shit
                        is to "get your head right" and create a character from thin air, and dont pull your punches.  
                        Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your 
                        F!@# off Mind. You choose a race (such as human or halfling or fucking elf you basic bitch)
                        and a class (such as fighter or wizard cuz you lame AF). You also get to come up with the persona,
                        look, and epic for your character. Once your bitch ass finishes, your character will serves
                        as your sudo in the game, your avatar in that Dungeons and Dragons epicness. Untill you fuck up.
