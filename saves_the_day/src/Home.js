                                        Fist things First:
                        Your first step in geting down in an adventurer such as Dungeons & Dragons Shit
                        is to imagine and create a character of your own, and dont pull your punches.  
                        Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your 
                        imagination. You choose a race (such as human or halfling or fucking elf you basic bitch)
                        and a class (such as fighter or wizard cuz you lame AF). You also invent the persona,
                        look, and tail for your character. Once your bitch ass finishes, your character serves
                        as your sudo in the game, your avatar in that Dungeons and Dragons epicness.
